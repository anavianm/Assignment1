			<p>The Stuffy story starts in the basement of my childhood home, where I learned how to repair my own stuffed animal after it went through years of wear and tear. Soon I was repairing stuffed animals for friends' younger siblings to improve my sewing. It was a matter of time before I was getting requests from hundreds of people to repair their old and beloved stuffed animals. With each stuffed animal came a special story and connection to its owners. Now, we work specifically with hospitals around the world, repairing Stuffed Animals for children who rely on them for love and support each and every day. </p>
		
			<p>Our team of sewers work tirelessly day in and day out to repair the Stuffed Animals sent to us and return them to their original condition. For every stuffed animal we repair, we donate two more to a child in need, anywhere in the world. </p>
